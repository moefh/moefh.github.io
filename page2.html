<p>
I wrote a very simple library to make the ESP32 talk via I2C to Wii
controllers like the Wii Nunchuk and the Wii Classic Controller.
</p>

<p>
There are a few libraries around that do this for the Arduino using
the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/reference/wire"><code>Wire</code> library</a>, but
for some reason that doesn't work consistently with the ESP32 and the
Wii controllers.  So I wrote the I2C communication using the <a href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/peripherals/i2c.html">ESP-IDF
API</a>,
and it works really well, except that for some reason I wasn't able to
make it work at 400KHz (which is supposedly what the Wii controllers
accept), only at 100KHz.  That's a little disappointing, but good
enough for my purposes, which is using the controllers in the ESP32
port of Loser Corps.
</p>

<p>
While playing with it, I wrote a little test program to display the
state of the connected controller on a small OLED screen (SSD1306),
which is controlled using the <a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306">Adafruit SSD1306
library</a> also via I2C,
but using the <code>Wire</code> library:
</p>

  <div class="image-caption">Testing the Wii Classic Controler</div>
</div>

<p>
When using the Wii Classic Controller, the screen shows two triangles
that point on the direction where you move the sticks, growing in size
as you move the stick farther along.  Pressing each button lights a
corresponding character on the screen, and pulling the analog triggers
increases the size of two bars that appear on the left side.
</p>

<p>
When using the Wii Nunchuk, the screen shows a single triangle with
the status of the nunchuk stick and three bars to the left that show
the status of the X, Y and Z accelerometer readings.  Pressing C or Z
displays the corresponding letter on the screen.
</p>

<p>
I wrote this small test program mostly for fun, but it tests something
important: that my library, which uses I2C via ESP-IDF, can coexist
with <code>Wire</code> library.  When using them together, you just have to be
careful not to use the same ESP32 I2C port with the two libraries at
the same time.  In this program, my library uses I2C port 0 and the
<code>Wire</code> library uses I2C port 1 (by using the <code>Wire1</code> object).

This is just a quick update: I have added shooting to the game.  You
shoot by pressing â‘¡ in the Wiimote (or <code>D</code> in the Arduino joystick).
There can be at most 14 shots active at once, and they do nothing but
fly in a straight line until they hit a wall or the edge of the map.

I also ported the game to use the ESP-IDF framework (as opposed to the
Arduino framework, which originally used).  I'm trying to see if I can
decrease the memory used by the WiFi system so the game can use full
320x240 resolution while in networked mode, and the EDP-IDF framework
has lots of configuration options.  I haven't made much progress with
it yet: I was just recently able to make the game run at full speed,
after finding that I have to set not ony the processor clock to 240MHz
but also the flash SPI clock to 80MHz (apparently the flash speed is a
bottleneck, which is not surprising since we copy images directly from
flash to the framebuffer).

Working on the game network code, I was able to make two players (each
running their own game a separate ESP32) see each other's characters:

  <div class="image-caption">Second player (using the Wiimote).</div>

<p>
They're using
<a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/software/esp-now/overview">ESP-NOW</a>
(a protocol made by Espressif, the makers of ESP32) to communicate.
Currently code is very simple, it's really just a proof-of-concept.
Each ESP32 keeps broadcasting messages containing its character's
position and frame.  When it receives a message, it puts a second
character at the received location with the received frame to
represent the remote player.
</p>

<p>
The network part was much easier than expected, I got it running a
couple of hours after I was able to get WiFi running inside the game
(I had researched how to send and receive messages using ESP-NOW prior
to that).  The hard part was freeing enough memory to get the WiFi
system to start in the first place.  If you look closely at the
monitors in the photos, you can see that the image's borders are cut
at the sides: the drawing area is only 240x240 pixels (as opposed to
the usual 320x240).  The monitor still thinks it's using the old
resolution, in effect what I did was increase the horizontal front-
and back-porch of the VGA timing, which decreases the horizontal
resolution but keeps everything else unchanged (crucially, the hsync
timing).
</p>

<p>
That took care of the RAM, but we also had a ROM problem: with the
added WiFi library, the program binary itself ended up too big to fit
the flash (at least with the default Arduino IDE settings). So I
removed some sprites, an entire tileset (<code>castle</code>) and cut some tiles
from another tileset (<code>castle3</code>).  To do that I made the <code>conv_spr</code>
tool (in the <code>conv_img</code> directory in the Github repository) -- it's an
improvement of the tool I had made before but hadn't released.
</p>

<p>
The nice side of all that work is that now it's much easier to change
the resolution with the new VGA code.  It can also select between
using double framebuffers (as before) or a single framebuffer.  I made
that when researching ways to decrease VGA memory use -- it turns out
that the game <b>almost</b> runs well enough with a single framebuffer, but
it's not quite fast enough to draw the whole screen during
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_blanking_interval">vblank</a>
(the time when the monitor is not actively drawing the image), so the
top portion of the screen gets a little messed up if we try.  That's
why the solution I chose at the end was to decrease the resolution and
keep using two framebuffers, but I kept the code to use a single
framebuffer in case I need it for another project in the future.
