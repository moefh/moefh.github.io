<p>
I decided to take a break from porting Loser Corps to the ESP32, and
do something completely different: port Loser Corps to the Raspberry
Pi Pico!
</p>

<div class="image">

<p>
The
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-pico/specifications/">Pico</a>
is smaller than the ESP32, with about half as much RAM, flash and
clock frequency:
</p>

</table></div></div>


<p>
The Pico (like the ESP32) can adjust its main clock frequency: 133 MHz
is the official maximum, but I'm using it at 125 MHz because that
makes VGA signal generation much simpler: the 12.5 MHz pixel clock
required for the 320x240 VGA mode is exactly 1/10 of the main clock
(well, technically it should be 12.59 MHz, but 12.5 is close enough).

  <div class="image-caption">The Pico connected to my homemade DACs and a Wii Nunchuk. Ignore the row of LEDs on the second breadboard, I was using them to debug the output of my PIO program.</div>
</div>

<p>
There are some <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-playground/tree/master/scanvideo">example
programs</a>
that output VGA using an official <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-extras/tree/master/src/common/pico_scanvideo">library provided by the Raspberry
Pi
Foundation</a>,
but they don't work with my old CRT monitor.  I haven't looked at the
library or the examples too closely, but it seems that the pixel clock
they use is too far away from the spec for my monitor: 640x480 should
be 25.18 MHz, and from what I can tell the examples use 24.0 MHz.
</p>

<p>
One of the cool things about the Pico is that it has a programmable
input/output (PIO) hardware interface, which is basically a tiny
specialized processor that can run programs that perform I/O
operations independently from the main cores.  I used the PIO (fed via
DMA) for the VGA output.
</p>

<p>
After a lot of trial and failure, I went with an extremely simple PIO
program: it's just a single instruction that gets data from the DMA
and feeds it one byte at a time to 8 output pins.  The data has to be
prepared exactly the right way so the output is a correctly-timed VGA
signal, which is stays right as long as the PIO program runs at a
fixed frequency equal to the VGA pixel clock.  In practice, this means
that the images still need vertical and horizontal sync bits embedded
in them, like in the ESP32.
</p>

<p>
Maybe I will make a more complex PIO program when I get more
experience with it. It would be nice to make the program generate the
vertical and horizontal sync signals automatically, and free 2 bits of
image data for colors: we could have 3:3:2 bits for red:green:blue,
increasing the number of colors from 64 to 256.  For now, though, the
output is exactly the same as the ESP32 (2:2:2), which is nice because
I don't have to make new homemade DAC boards to connect to the
monitor.  Still, a really good advantage of the PIO (even running my
brain-dead program) over the I2S bus we use on the ESP32 is that it
doesn't scramble the byte order.
</p>

<p>
Even after everything was running, I ended up with problems with the
IRQ handler for the DMA completion (which restarts the DMA to keep the
PIO fed with data).  When the CPU got too busy (for example, in areas
of the map with too many things on the screen), the IRQ was being
delayed enough do disrupt the video signal, and my monitor <b>really</b>
didn't like it.  In the end I managed to make the render loop run
entirely without CPU supervision (it runs entirely on DMA shoving data
into the PIO), and it only generates and IRQ for frame counting, which
the game code uses to synchronize the framebuffer swapping (to avoid
screen tearing).
</p>

<p>
The only parts actually done right now are the rendering and joystick
input (Wii nunchuk and classic controller only). The character control
and collision detection will be done soon.

The game now sends shots over the network, so players can see each
other's shots:

  <div class="image-caption">Two players shooting</div>
</div>

<p>
(Please excuse me for not showing the two systems and screens
side-by-side, it's a pain to move everything around only to take a
quick picture.)
</p>

<p>
Another change: the game runs at 320x240 with WiFi enabled even when
compiled under the Arduino IDE, since I found out how to decrease the
number of WiFi buffers without recompiling the ESP-IDF WiFi component.
It turns out that the number of rx/tx buffers used in WiFi is set in
the struct returned by <code>WIFI_INIT_CONFIG_DEFAULT()</code>, which initializes
the fields to values defined in the WiFi component configuration.
Decreasing the values before passing the struct to <code>esp_wifi_init()</code>
does the trick.
</p>

<p>
To make it work in the Arduino IDE, I just had to stop using the
Arduino <code>WiFi</code> object and use the ESP-IDF API directly.  One small
snag I ran into was that the ESP-IDF version used by the Arduino Core
is pretty old, and to initialize the network you had to call
<code>tcpip_adapter_init()</code> instead of the current <code>esp_netif_init()</code>.
Once I solved that, the network code compiles and runs with no
problems.  There's just an annoying error that pops out in the serial
complaining that I haven't created an event loop, which I think is
required for the Arduino Core <code>WiFi</code> object to receive WiFi events.
The game seems to run fine without it, though.

The game now runs with networking enabled while using the full 320x240
resolution:
</p>

<div class="image">

  <div class="image-caption">Two ESP32s talking to each other via ESP-NOW, each one controlling a character (note also the Wii Classic Controller)</div>
</div>

<p>
To fit WiFi and the two 320x240 framebuffers in memory, I had to make
some changes: first, don't use Bluetooth -- so the Wiimote is out.
Luckily I now can use the Wii Classic Controller (as shown in the
picture) or Wii Nunchuk, so that's not a big deal.
</p>

<p>
Second, I had to decrease the number of transmit and receive buffers
used by the WiFi library.  This can't be changed in with the Arduino
Core for the ESP32, so I can't use the Arduino IDE for this.  Using
the ESP-IDF framework, this (and a lot more) can be changed with
<code>idf.py menuconfig</code>:
</p>

  <img width="820" height="515" src="/2021/05/16/Porting-Loser-Corps-to-the-ESP32-Part-6/menuconfig.png" alt="Adjusting the number of WiFi receive buffers" title="Adjusting the number of WiFi receive buffers">
  <div class="image-caption">Adjusting the number of WiFi receive buffers</div>
</div>

<p>
Thankfully it's not too much of a hassle to use the same code with the
two APIs (which is not that surprising, since the Arduino Core is just
an added layer on top of the ESP-IDF).  The largest hurdle was to
learn how to set the CPU clock using the ESP-IDF (it's a lot more
involved than I thought, I ended up lifting code from the Arduino
Core) and to support the Wiimote library, which uses the Bluetooth API
from the Arduino Core (so once more I lifted some code from there).
</p>

<p>
In the end, it was fun and I learned a little bit about FreeRTOS
(which the Arduino Core completely hides) in order to run my code on
one of the CPUs of the ESP32 and let the WiFi and other stuff use the
other one.
</p>

<p>
The other change in the game since the last update post was the
addition of Wii Nunchuk and Classic Controller support via I2C with my
<a href="https://github.com/moefh/esp32-wii-nunchuk">esp32-wii-nunchuk</a>
library.
</p>

<p>
After plugging the library to the game code, I noticed that sometimes
the I2C read from the controller gets stuck for a little bit.  Usually
that's not a big problem, but for this game any hiccup is really
noticeable and annoying (the engine <b>really</b> wants to run at 60fps).
So I had to add some functions to the library to run a loop that reads
the controller state in a different CPU core than the game engine, and
it ended up working really well.
</p>

<p>
The source code for the version of the game that uses the Arduino API
is here:
<a href="https://github.com/moefh/esp32-loser">https://github.com/moefh/esp32-loser</a>. I
haven't published the version using the ESP-IDF yet, but it just adds
some stuff to compile under ESP-IDF.
