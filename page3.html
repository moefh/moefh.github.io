<i>More progress in porting Loser Corps to the ESP32 (see <a href="/tags/esp32-loser">all posts about the port</a>).</i>
</p>

<p>
The game now runs with networking enabled while using the full 320x240
resolution:
</p>

  <div class="image-caption">Two ESP32s talking to each other via ESP-NOW, each one controlling a character (note also the Wii Classic Controller)</div>
</div>

<p>
To fit WiFi and the two 320x240 framebuffers in memory, I had to make
some changes: first, don't use Bluetooth -- so the Wiimote is out.
Luckily I now can use the Wii Classic Controller (as shown in the
picture) or Wii Nunchuk, so that's not a big deal.
</p>

<p>
Second, I had to decrease the number of transmit and receive buffers
used by the WiFi library.  This can't be changed in with the Arduino
Core for the ESP32, so I can't use the Arduino IDE for this.  Using
the ESP-IDF framework, this (and a lot more) can be changed with
<code>idf.py menuconfig</code>:
</p>

  <div class="image-caption">Adjusting the number of WiFi receive buffers</div>
</div>

<p>
Thankfully it's not too much of a hassle to use the same code with the
two APIs (which is not that surprising, since the Arduino Core is just
an added layer on top of the ESP-IDF).  The largest hurdle was to
learn how to set the CPU clock using the ESP-IDF (it's a lot more
involved than I thought, I ended up lifting code from the Arduino
Core) and to support the Wiimote library, which uses the Bluetooth API
from the Arduino Core (so once more I lifted some code from there).
</p>

<p>
In the end, it was fun and I learned a little bit about FreeRTOS
(which the Arduino Core completely hides) in order to run my code on
one of the CPUs of the ESP32 and let the WiFi and other stuff use the
other one.
</p>

<p>
The other change in the game since the last update post was the
addition of Wii Nunchuk and Classic Controller support via I2C with my
<a href="https://github.com/moefh/esp32-wii-nunchuk">esp32-wii-nunchuk</a>
library.
</p>

<p>
After plugging the library to the game code, I noticed that sometimes
the I2C read from the controller gets stuck for a little bit.  Usually
that's not a big problem, but for this game any hiccup is really
noticeable and annoying (the engine <b>really</b> wants to run at 60fps).
So I had to add some functions to the library to run a loop that reads
the controller state in a different CPU core than the game engine, and
it ended up working really well.
</p>

<p>
The source code for the version of the game that uses the Arduino API
is here:
<a href="https://github.com/moefh/esp32-loser">https://github.com/moefh/esp32-loser</a>. I
haven't published the version using the ESP-IDF yet, but it just adds
some stuff to compile under ESP-IDF.

I wrote a very simple library to make the ESP32 talk via I2C to Wii
controllers like the Wii Nunchuk and the Wii Classic Controller.
</p>

<p>
There are a few libraries around that do this for the Arduino using
the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/reference/wire"><code>Wire</code> library</a>, but
for some reason that doesn't work consistently with the ESP32 and the
Wii controllers.  So I wrote the I2C communication using the <a href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/peripherals/i2c.html">ESP-IDF
API</a>,
and it works really well, except that for some reason I wasn't able to
make it work at 400KHz (which is supposedly what the Wii controllers
accept), only at 100KHz.  That's a little disappointing, but good
enough for my purposes, which is using the controllers in the ESP32
port of Loser Corps.
</p>

<p>
While playing with it, I wrote a little test program to display the
state of the connected controller on a small OLED screen (SSD1306),
which is controlled using the <a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306">Adafruit SSD1306
library</a> also via I2C,
but using the <code>Wire</code> library:
</p>

<div class="image">
  <img width="640" height="480" src="/2021/05/15/Using-Wii-I2C-Controllers-on-the-ESP32/photo.jpg" alt="Testing the Wii Classic Controler" title="Testing the Wii Classic Controler">
  <div class="image-caption">Testing the Wii Classic Controler</div>
</div>

<p>
When using the Wii Classic Controller, the screen shows two triangles
that point on the direction where you move the sticks, growing in size
as you move the stick farther along.  Pressing each button lights a
corresponding character on the screen, and pulling the analog triggers
increases the size of two bars that appear on the left side.
</p>

<p>
When using the Wii Nunchuk, the screen shows a single triangle with
the status of the nunchuk stick and three bars to the left that show
the status of the X, Y and Z accelerometer readings.  Pressing C or Z
displays the corresponding letter on the screen.
</p>

<p>
I wrote this small test program mostly for fun, but it tests something
important: that my library, which uses I2C via ESP-IDF, can coexist
with <code>Wire</code> library.  When using them together, you just have to be
careful not to use the same ESP32 I2C port with the two libraries at
the same time.  In this program, my library uses I2C port 0 and the
<code>Wire</code> library uses I2C port 1 (by using the <code>Wire1</code> object).
</p>

This is just a quick update: I have added shooting to the game.  You
shoot by pressing â‘¡ in the Wiimote (or <code>D</code> in the Arduino joystick).
There can be at most 14 shots active at once, and they do nothing but
fly in a straight line until they hit a wall or the edge of the map.

I also ported the game to use the ESP-IDF framework (as opposed to the
Arduino framework, which originally used).  I'm trying to see if I can
decrease the memory used by the WiFi system so the game can use full
320x240 resolution while in networked mode, and the EDP-IDF framework
has lots of configuration options.  I haven't made much progress with
it yet: I was just recently able to make the game run at full speed,
after finding that I have to set not ony the processor clock to 240MHz
but also the flash SPI clock to 80MHz (apparently the flash speed is a
bottleneck, which is not surprising since we copy images directly from
flash to the framebuffer).
