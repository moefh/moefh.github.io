I finished bringing the Loser Corps port on the Pico on par with the
ESP32, and then added sound output supporting 4 sounds plus music at
the same time, with music coming from a MOD player I wrote from
scratch for the Pico.
</p>

<p class="header-1">Sound Hardware</p>

<p>
First, let's look at the hardware side. This is my homemade sound
amplifier board:
</p>

<div class="image">
  <img width="640" height="480" src="/2021/07/31/Porting-Loser-Corps-to-the-Raspberry-Pi-Pico-Part-2/amplifier.jpg" alt="Homemade amplifier using an  LM386" title="Homemade amplifier using an  LM386">
  <div class="image-caption">Homemade amplifier using an  LM386</div>
</div>

<p>
The input is at the 3-pin female header at the top (VCC, GND and
input) and the output is at the 2-pin male header on the left (GND and
output).  This board is very similar to what I had in the last post in
the breadboard, I just changed some capacitor values and moved the
potentiometer for the volume control to go between the input coupling
capacitor (now 2.2 μF) and the LM386. Here is the updated schematic:
</p>

<div class="image">

  <div class="image-caption">Homemade amplifier using an `LM386`</div>
</div>

<p>
One thing I didn't mention in the last post is that I tried using
generic potentiometers for the volume control, but the metal casing
added a lot of noise (this may be be a common thing, or it might be
just because I live pretty close to some big radio towers, I have no
idea). I ended up buying the sound table potentiometers you see in the
photos, they're more expensive but work pretty well.
</p>

<p class="header-1">Sound Code</p>

<p>
Now, the software side.  The sound code is based on the setup I had on
the last post, with the addition of MOD music playing. It can play
music plus up to 4 other sounds at the same time.
</p>

<p>
The music is played with a simple MOD player I wrote from scratch for
the Pico.  The player supports only 4 channels (easily changed in a
<code>#define</code>) and is currently missing a lot of MOD effects like tremolo
and vibrato, but it's good enough to play a really good <a href="https://modarchive.org/index.php?request=view_by_moduleid&query=177642">Axel F
MOD</a>
pretty close to what VLC does, so I'm happy with it. I also tested it
with the MOD files from Flashback (the game from 1992) and a few other
MODs from <a href="https://modarchive.org/">modarchive.org</a>.
</p>

<p>
The player modulates notes by streching or compressing the input
samples to the required sample rate, always choosing the nearest input
sample (think scaling an image using the "nearest" algorithm).  It
causes aliasing but it's very fast -- I use a fixed point number
(<code>20.12</code>) to store the index of the current sample, and add <code>fi/fo</code> to
it after playing each sample, where <code>fi</code> is the sample rate of the
note and <code>fo</code> is the sample rate of the output sound (22050Hz).  So if
the MOD requests a sample to be played at 22050Hz, <code>fi/fo</code> would be
<code>1</code> and the sample would be played without any modulation (i.e., each
input sample would be sent exactly once to the output); if the
frequency requested is 11025Hz (half), then <code>fi/fo</code> would be <code>0.5</code> and
each input sample would be sent twice since it would take two
additions to the sample index to advance to the next sample.
</p>

<p>
Of course things are a little more complicated than that, because MOD
files store the sample frequency as periods of the original Amiga
clock (7.09379 MHz), so there's some annoying math involved (the
annoying part is in making sure we get a reasonable precision while
avoiding overflow).  To get the gory details, see the file
<code>game/lib/mod_player.c</code> on Github.
</p>

<p>
I might improve the MOD player in the future, but I'm pretty happy
with it for now.
</p>

<p>
Other than the MOD player, I added some sound effects. There's a small
"bump" sound then the player character hits the ground (I recorded it
by gently tapping a microphone some 20 years ago when making the game
on PC) and a generic explosion sound when a shot hits something (taken
from a free sound library from 20 years ago).
</p>

<p class="header-1">Other Code Improvements</p>

<p>
And finally, not related to sound at all, a small improvement: I added
some tile caching when drawing the screen to improve the speed, making
sure the game never drops under 60 frames per second.  Some parts of
the map use too many different tiles, which used to cause problems
because the CPU couldn't stream data from the flash fast enough to
draw the entire screen in 16 miliseconds. So I copy some of the
most-used tiles to RAM at the start, and that fixes the problem.

I started playing with sound with the Raspberry Pi Pico.  I'm using
using an LM386 amplifier and an old 8Ω speaker:

  <div class="image-caption">Photo of the Pico, the LM386 amplifier and the speaker</div>
</div>

<p>
For the sound generation code, I'm using the PWM/DMA method described
in <a href="https://gregchadwick.co.uk/blog/playing-with-the-pico-pt3/">this blog
post</a>.  It
uses PWM sounds with 8-bit samples at 22050 Hz.  I wrote a simple
mixer on top of that to play multiple sounds at the same time, and an
easy-to-use API for starting sounds with the option to loop, since
I'll add this to the Pico <a href="/2021/06/06/Porting-Loser-Corps-to-the-Raspberry-Pi-Pico">Loser Corps port</a>.
</p>

<p>
This is the schematic for the sound output:
</p>

<div class="image">
  <img width="640" height="340" src="/2021/07/17/Sound-Output-with-the-Raspberry-Pi-Pico/amp-schematic.png" alt="Sound output schematic" title="Sound output schematic">
  <div class="image-caption">Sound output schematic</div>
</div>

<p>
I'm using a voltage divider with 2.2K/1K to bring the sound signal in
the range 0-1V in with a 100nF capacitor in parallel to filter the
unwanted high frequencies, connecting the result to the input of the
LM386 using a potentiometer for volume control.  The rest of the
schematic was taken from the "typical application" section of the
LM386 datasheet.  Leaving its pins 1, 7 and 8 not connected results in
a gain of 20, which is enough for my tests.
</p>

<p>
I had to change some resistors and capacitors because I didn't have
the recommended values available. The 75Ω connected to the <code>SOUND_PIN</code>
was meant to be a 68Ω, and the 100nF capacitor on the LM386 output was
meant to be 50nF.
</p>

<p>
I also decided to use a 1000μF capacitor on the LM386 output instead
of the 250μF recommended by the datasheet to try to improve the bass.
I don't think it matters too much with that crappy speaker, but it
doesn't hurt.
</p>

<p>
The overall sound quality is not that great: the sample size is 8
bits, and the whole thing is mounted on a breadbord. But it's usable
for now, and probably good enough for the game sound effects.
</p>

<p>
The code keeps playing a synth sound on loop, and queues a small drum
sound when you press the button. For completeness, here's the
schematic showing the Pico connections, including the button that
triggers the drum sound:
</p>

<div class="image">
  <img width="300" height="350" src="/2021/07/17/Sound-Output-with-the-Raspberry-Pi-Pico/pico-schematic.png" alt="Pico connections schematic" title="Pico connections schematic">
  <div class="image-caption">Pico connections schematic</div>
</div>

<p>
The code is set up to mix up to 4 sounds, so if you press the
button too quickly it will start ignoring presses until there are less
than 4 sound playing at the same time.
</p>

<p>
The sound generation code is in <code>audio.c</code> and <code>audio.h</code>, this is the
API:
</p>

<div class="multiline-code-wrapper">
<div class="multiline-code">
<pre>  // init
  audio_init(SOUND_PIN);
  
  // play once (use the returned sound_id to control volume or stop)
  int sound_id = audio_play_once(samples, num_samples);

  // set audio volume (8.8 fixed point)
  audio_source_set_volume(sound_id, 3<<8);

  // play in loop (3rd argument says where to start the loop)
  sound_id = audio_play_loop(samples, num_samples, 0);

  // stop playing
  audio_source_stop(sound_id);
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<p>
The mixer must be manually called at least once every 45 milliseconds
or so (this interval depends on the sound buffer size configured in
<code>audio.h</code>; a larger buffer allows for more time between calls at the
expense of more latency for starting sounds):
</p>

<div class="multiline-code-wrapper">
<div class="multiline-code">
<pre>  while (1) {
    audio_mixer_step();

    // ... other code ...

    sleep_ms(30);
  }
  
</pre>

<p>
In the process of creating a new perfboard to connect the Pico to a
VGA monitor, I realized that all the VGA DACs I made so far are using
only half the voltage range, which results in a very dark image all
around.
</p>

<p>
Here's what I figure happened: the initial schematic I drew for a the
DAC used a 75 Ohm resistor to ground, which I initially put there to
represent the one inside the monitor (so I could calculate the values
for the other resistors). Later, when building the boards, I put that
75 Ohm resistor on the board, so there were TWO 75 Ohm resistors to
ground in parallel, which results in everything being roughly half the
voltage it's supposed to be.  Later, when looking at that schematic, I
though I had put that resistor there for impedance matching (which I
knew was not really right), so I left it alone.
</p>

<p>
When I started builiding a perfboard for the Pico (to make it more
permanent that the breadboard I had last week), I decided to calculate
everything from scratch, and I realized the mistake.  My correction
still uses a 75 Ohm to ground, but the other resistors have much lower
values to compensate.  The current drawn from the pins is much larger,
but still below 15 mA, so I think that will bo OK for the Pico and the
ESP32.
</p>

<p>
Here's the new schematic for each DAC:
</p>

<div class="image">

  <div class="image-caption">New DAC schematic</div>
</div>

<p>
And here's the Loser Corps screen with the new DACs:
</p>

<div class="image">
  <img width="640" height="480" src="/2021/06/13/New-VGA-Boards/screen-new-dacs.jpg" alt="Loser Corps running on the Pico with the new DACs" title="Loser Corps running on the Pico with the new DACs">
  <div class="image-caption">Loser Corps running on the Pico with the new DACs</div>
</div>

<p>
Here's the screen with the old DACs for comparison:
</p>

  <div class="image-caption">Screen with the old DACs</div>
</div>

<p>
The new perfboards have the resistors soldered on the main board where
the the Pico and the ESP32 are inserted, and the small boards with the
VGA connectors have with nothing but female headers with 6 pins to
connect to the main board.  This way, if I ever want to change DACs
again, I don't have to solder wires to the VGA connector (which is a
very unpleasant job).

<p>
The Pico board has two sets of connections for I2C (for the Wii
Nunchuk). I'll add these connections to the ESP32 board later.
