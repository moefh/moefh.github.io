In the process of creating a new perfboard to connect the Pico to a
VGA monitor, I realized that all the VGA DACs I made so far are using
only half the voltage range, which results in a very dark image all
around.
</p>

<p>
Here's what I figure happened: the initial schematic I drew for a the
DAC used a 75 Ohm resistor to ground, which I initially put there to
represent the one inside the monitor (so I could calculate the values
for the other resistors). Later, when building the boards, I put that
75 Ohm resistor on the board, so there were TWO 75 Ohm resistors to
ground in parallel, which results in everything being roughly half the
voltage it's supposed to be.  Later, when looking at that schematic, I
though I had put that resistor there for impedance matching (which I
knew was not really right), so I left it alone.
</p>

<p>
When I started builiding a perfboard for the Pico (to make it more
permanent that the breadboard I had last week), I decided to calculate
everything from scratch, and I realized the mistake.  My correction
still uses a 75 Ohm to ground, but the other resistors have much lower
values to compensate.  The current drawn from the pins is much larger,
but still below 15 mA, so I think that will bo OK for the Pico and the
ESP32.
</p>

<p>
Here's the new schematic for each DAC:

<p>
And here's the Loser Corps screen with the new DACs:

Here's the screen with the old DACs for comparison:

  <div class="image-caption">Screen with the old DACs</div>
</div>

<p>
The new perfboards have the resistors soldered on the main board where
the the Pico and the ESP32 are inserted, and the small boards with the
VGA connectors have with nothing but female headers with 6 pins to
connect to the main board.  This way, if I ever want to change DACs
again, I don't have to solder wires to the VGA connector (which is a
very unpleasant job).

<p>
The Pico board has two sets of connections for I2C (for the Wii
Nunchuk). I'll add these connections to the ESP32 board later.

I decided to take a break from porting Loser Corps to the ESP32, and
do something completely different: port Loser Corps to the Raspberry
Pi Pico!
</p>

<p>
The
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-pico/specifications/">Pico</a>
is smaller than the ESP32, with about half as much RAM, flash and
clock frequency:
</p>

</table></div></div>


<p>
The Pico (like the ESP32) can adjust its main clock frequency: 133 MHz
is the official maximum, but I'm using it at 125 MHz because that
makes VGA signal generation much simpler: the 12.5 MHz pixel clock
required for the 320x240 VGA mode is exactly 1/10 of the main clock
(well, technically it should be 12.59 MHz, but 12.5 is close enough).

  <div class="image-caption">The Pico connected to my homemade DACs and a Wii Nunchuk. Ignore the row of LEDs on the second breadboard, I was using them to debug the output of my PIO program.</div>
</div>

<p>
There are some <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-playground/tree/master/scanvideo">example
programs</a>
that output VGA using an official <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-extras/tree/master/src/common/pico_scanvideo">library provided by the Raspberry
Pi
Foundation</a>,
but they don't work with my old CRT monitor.  I haven't looked at the
library or the examples too closely, but it seems that the pixel clock
they use is too far away from the spec for my monitor: 640x480 should
be 25.18 MHz, and from what I can tell the examples use 24.0 MHz.
</p>

<p>
One of the cool things about the Pico is that it has a programmable
input/output (PIO) hardware interface, which is basically a tiny
specialized processor that can run programs that perform I/O
operations independently from the main cores.  I used the PIO (fed via
DMA) for the VGA output.
</p>

<p>
After a lot of trial and failure, I went with an extremely simple PIO
program: it's just a single instruction that gets data from the DMA
and feeds it one byte at a time to 8 output pins.  The data has to be
prepared exactly the right way so the output is a correctly-timed VGA
signal, which is stays right as long as the PIO program runs at a
fixed frequency equal to the VGA pixel clock.  In practice, this means
that the images still need vertical and horizontal sync bits embedded
in them, like in the ESP32.
</p>

<p>
Maybe I will make a more complex PIO program when I get more
experience with it. It would be nice to make the program generate the
vertical and horizontal sync signals automatically, and free 2 bits of
image data for colors: we could have 3:3:2 bits for red:green:blue,
increasing the number of colors from 64 to 256.  For now, though, the
output is exactly the same as the ESP32 (2:2:2), which is nice because
I don't have to make new homemade DAC boards to connect to the
monitor.  Still, a really good advantage of the PIO (even running my
brain-dead program) over the I2S bus we use on the ESP32 is that it
doesn't scramble the byte order.
</p>

<p>
Even after everything was running, I ended up with problems with the
IRQ handler for the DMA completion (which restarts the DMA to keep the
PIO fed with data).  When the CPU got too busy (for example, in areas
of the map with too many things on the screen), the IRQ was being
delayed enough do disrupt the video signal, and my monitor <b>really</b>
didn't like it.  In the end I managed to make the render loop run
entirely without CPU supervision (it runs entirely on DMA shoving data
into the PIO), and it only generates and IRQ for frame counting, which
the game code uses to synchronize the framebuffer swapping (to avoid
screen tearing).
</p>

<p>
The only parts actually done right now are the rendering and joystick
input (Wii nunchuk and classic controller only). The character control
and collision detection will be done soon.

The game now sends shots over the network, so players can see each
other's shots:

<p>
(Please excuse me for not showing the two systems and screens
side-by-side, it's a pain to move everything around only to take a
quick picture.)
</p>

<p>
Another change: the game runs at 320x240 with WiFi enabled even when
compiled under the Arduino IDE, since I found out how to decrease the
number of WiFi buffers without recompiling the ESP-IDF WiFi component.
It turns out that the number of rx/tx buffers used in WiFi is set in
the struct returned by <code>WIFI_INIT_CONFIG_DEFAULT()</code>, which initializes
the fields to values defined in the WiFi component configuration.
Decreasing the values before passing the struct to <code>esp_wifi_init()</code>
does the trick.
</p>

<p>
To make it work in the Arduino IDE, I just had to stop using the
Arduino <code>WiFi</code> object and use the ESP-IDF API directly.  One small
snag I ran into was that the ESP-IDF version used by the Arduino Core
is pretty old, and to initialize the network you had to call
<code>tcpip_adapter_init()</code> instead of the current <code>esp_netif_init()</code>.
Once I solved that, the network code compiles and runs with no
problems.  There's just an annoying error that pops out in the serial
complaining that I haven't created an event loop, which I think is
required for the Arduino Core <code>WiFi</code> object to receive WiFi events.
The game seems to run fine without it, though.
